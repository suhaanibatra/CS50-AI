#### Trial 1
With two rounds of convolution and pooling dropout = 0.25 and 128 dense, maximum training acccuracy = 95.65%

#### Trial 2
With two rounds of convolution and pooling dropout = 0.5 and 128 dense, maximum training acccuracy = 88.64%

#### Trial 3
With two rounds of convolution and pooling dropout = 0.5 and 256 dense, maximum training acccuracy = 91.3%

#### Trial 4
With two rounds of convolution and pooling dropout = 0.25 and 256 dense, maximum training acccuracy = 95.74%

#### Trial 5
With three rounds of convolution and pooling dropout = 0.25 and 256 dense, maximum training acccuracy = 96.37%

#### Findings
Higher dropout rate corresponds to a lower accuracy, optimal dropout rate needed. Higher the number of rounds of convolution and pooling, better the result.
